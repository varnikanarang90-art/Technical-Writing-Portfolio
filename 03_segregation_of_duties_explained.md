# Understanding Segregation of Duties (SoD)  
*A Sample Concept Explanation*

## What Is SoD?  
Segregation of Duties (SoD) means separating critical responsibilities among different people so no single person can complete all steps of a high-risk process. This prevents fraud and reduces operational errors.

---

## Example  
A single person should not be able to:  
- Create a vendor **and**  
- Approve payment to that vendor  

If one user has both abilities, they can commit fraud.  
SoD prevents this.

## Why SoD Matters  
- Prevents financial fraud  
- Reduces mistakes  
- Required for audits and regulations such as SOX  
- Ensures clean, controlled processes
